**Inventory System**

This project is a inventory system for a store/warehouse, implemented in C++. The application is designed to manage products, their locations in a store and warehouse, and facilitate order fulfillment using object-oriented principles, including inheritance, linked lists, and queues.

**Features**

- **Store Location Management**: The system tracks products available in-store and warehouse locations, supporting FIFO management of warehouse stock.
- **Product Management**: Products can be stored, retrieved, and moved between locations.
- **Queue Management**: Implements a queue to manage warehouse locations and ensure older stock is used first.
- **User Interaction**: A user-friendly interface that allows for product management, including adding stock, removing stock, and fulfilling orders.
